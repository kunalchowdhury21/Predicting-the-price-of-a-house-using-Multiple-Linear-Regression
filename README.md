# Multiple-linear-regression-on-predicting-the-price-of-a-house

Multiple linear regression is the most common form of linear regression analysis. As a predictive analysis, multiple linear regression in used to explain the relationship between one continuous dependent variable and two or more independent variables. The independent variables can be continuous or categorial.

Here we have a dataset where the independent paarameteres are 'Avg. Area Income', 'Avg. Area House Age', 'Avg. Area Number of Rooms', 'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms' and 'Area Population' and the dependent parameter is 'Price'.

Steps to predtict:
1) We first import the required 'Housing.csv' file into the JupyterLab.
2) Then we load the data into two variables X and y, where X stores multiple variables(independent parameters) and y store the dependent parameter i.e Price.
3) Then we split the model into train and test sets and apply the linear regression.
4) Then we predict the train and test set results using the linear regression model.
5) In the end we find the required errors.
